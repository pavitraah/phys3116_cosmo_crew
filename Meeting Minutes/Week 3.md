# Cosmo Crew Week 3 Minutes

**Date:** 03/10/25

**Time:** 4:30pm

**Attendees:** Pavitraa, Emily, Samah

## Meeting objective

What we've done so far - what graphs we have plotted so far.
Next steps for plotting

## Discussion points

- Pav has merged different dataframes together and plotted the position of the GCs - masking out the clusters that are further away
- Emily has compared the merged data and created plots of age vs metallicity
- We could plot rotational velocity vs mass, with age on the colourbar 
- We can also put the position mask onto the the age vs metallicity

## Action Items
| Group Member | Action | Due |
|:---:|---|---|
| Pav | Add a colour bar to the position charts to show rotational velocity | 10/10/25 |
| Emily | Plot the velocity dispersion vs mass | 10/10/25 |
| Samah | Add a colour bar to the age vs metallicity plots to show distance from galactic centre | 03/10/25 |
