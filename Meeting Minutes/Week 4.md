## Meeting objective

How can we take the graphs that we have plotted and come to a conclusion about which clusters are accreted?

## Discussion points

- Emily has plotted the velocity dispersion vs mass graph
- Samah has added colour maps to the metallicty vs age
- All will look at the current plots and extract possible accreted clusters over the weekend
- We will start to put together slides
